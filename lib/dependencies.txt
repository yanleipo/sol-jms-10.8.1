SolJMS Dependencies

Dependencies required to build/run Solace JMS based applications are bundled in the lib directory.

The lib directory also includes legacy sol-common-<version>.jar and
sol-jcsmp-<version>.jar of which contents have now been moved to sol-jms-<version>.jar
and are no longer needed.

NOTICE: Including log4j-1.2.9.jar without a log4j.properties file on the classpath
may impact program performance by turning the log level to DEBUG.
